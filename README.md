# Thermal-Video-Decoder / Thermal-Video-Read
This program is to read thermal video sequences through Mobile Thermal Imaging

# Mobile Thermal Imaging
Mobile Thermal Imaging (Mobile Thermography) is a new technology that maximizes its mobility and scalability of thermal imaging by employing a new category of low-cost, mobile thermal cameras (e.g., FLIR One, SeekThermal, Therm-App Hz) which can be used as a smartphone accessary.

This program is for extracting raw matrix sequences from a thermal video recorded by mobile thermal imaging (e.g., RRT thermal camera / Android Play Store)
